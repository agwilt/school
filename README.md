School projects. I'll probably cringe when I look at this code in a few years.

This is for the IT Facharbeit explaining ray casters.

To demonstrate the ray caster, I'm making a simple game, Conway's Game of Life, rendered in 3D, because   ![tree](http://static.wixstatic.com/media/6e4597_8bd6271cdb3946249b18beb9348c89cc.png_srz_163_184_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_png_srz) TREE.

Ideas:
 - make life generation speed slow, but fast when you move/do something
 - add functionality to "kill" cell, thereby altering the game to save yourself.
 - have light vector, so that different sides of the cubes have different colours
 - also make things lighter with distance (like fog)
 
Torus?
 - cells: probably
 - movement: only if renderer does it
 - renderer: would be hard. But fun. Fade to ... fog?
 
 
Colours:
 - white background, cells are black
 - floor is light grey
 - far away thing fade to white
