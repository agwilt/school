School projects. I'll probably cringe when I look at this code in a few years.

This is for the IT Facharbeit explaining ray casters.

To demonstrate the ray caster, I'm making a simple game, Conway's Game of Life, rendered in 3D, because tree.

Ideas:
 - make life generation speed slow, but fast when you move/do something
 - add functionality to "kill" cell, thereby altering the game to save yourself.
 
Torus?
 - cells: probably
 - movement: only if renderer does it
 - renderer: would be hard. But fun. Fade to ... fog?
 
 
Colours:
 - white background, cells are black
 - floor is light grey
 - far away thing fade to white
