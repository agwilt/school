fix walking: controls and checking

A ray caster explained using only the top 1000 most used words:
LINE-THROW-CHECKER

A line goes forwards in a direction and hits walls. You find how long the line goes to see how far away the wall is.

To be faster, the walls are blocks next to each other, and the line hits the sides of the blocks. First we see if/when the line hits the sides going up, and then the ones going to the side. We find the first point where the line goes to a new block, and then make the line longer by a fixed number in each direction, to check the new block.
